Ch.6 - Creating a Swap Space

Steps: 
1.Create a partition w/ a fs type "swap-linux"
  Ex:
  - parted /dev/sdb1 mkpart swap1 linux-swap 2048s 1001MB
  - udevadm settle

2.Place a swap signature on the device
  Ex:
  - mkswap /dev/sdb1

3.Activate the formatted Swap Space w/ the "swapon" cmd 
  Ex:
  - swapon /dev/sdb1

4.Persistently activating Swap Space with /etc/fstab config file
  Ex:
  - UUID=39e2667a-9458-42fe-9665-c5c854605881   swap   swap   defaults   0 0
  - systemctl daemon-reload

5.Setting the Swap Space Priority
  Ex:
  - UUID=39e2667a-9458-42fe-9665-c5c854605881   swap   swap  pri=4   0 0
  - systemctl daemon-reload

(notice that pri=4 has replaced defaults)
**pri(priority)
**the kernel uses the swap space w/ the highest priority first
**default priority is -2
 
Ex: The following example shows three swap spaces defined in /etc/fstab. The kernel uses the last entry first, with pri=10. When that space is full, it us es the second entry, with pri=4. Finally, it uses the first entry, which has  a default priority of -2.

  UUID=af30cbb0-3866-466a-825a-58889a49ef33   swap   swap   defaults  0 0
  UUID=39e2667a-9458-42fe-9665-c5c854605881   swap   swap   pri=4     0 0
  UUID=fbd7fa60-b781-44a8-961b-37ac3ef572bf   swap   swap   pri=10    0 0



Notes:

"The second field is typically reserved for the mount point. However, for swap devices, which are not accessible through the directory structure, this field takes the placeholder value swap."

"When you add or remove an entry in the /etc/fstab file, run thesystemctl daemon-reload command, or reboot the server, for systemd to register the new configuration."


More Useful Cmds: 

  swapon -a;     to activate all swap spaces listed in /etc/fstab 
  swapon --show; to inspect the available swap spaces
  free;          to inspect the available swap spaces 
  swapoff;       to deactivate a swap space


Cool Cmd:
expr (I use the is to calculate arithmetic (i.e. expr 5144 + 2547))
